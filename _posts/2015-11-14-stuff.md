title: Progress report - week of 11/8/15-11/16/15
---

<p>Today we had our weekly meeting with our mentor to determine what we have done this weekend and we need to get done by next week. We do have our circuits built and we are currently writing our test harnesses to communicate with our sensors. We are also working to get our sensors on perfboards, so far we have our tape sensors and one beacon detector on perfboards. We have been able to run our motors with our H-Bridge, and we have most of our parts that we need. </p><br />

<p>Meanwhile we are also very behind because we didn't laser cut our base until today so we haven't assembled our robot and determined the flaws of our design. We also spent too much time on the solidworks model instead of building our base to start integrating our system. Our mentor proposed a strict plan to get our assembly up and running. First we need to find Acrylic to create our wheel mounts and a wireless drill. We are going to laser cut today, and by Sunday we should have our base cutout and assembled. Then for each day after that we should have our components installed and ready to test, motors on Monday, tape and bump sensors on Tuesday, Track wire sensor by Friday, launcher hardware and the beacon detector by Saturday night.</p>

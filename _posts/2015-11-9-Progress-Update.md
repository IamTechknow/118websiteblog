title: November 9 Progress Update
---

It has been a couple days since we meet our mentor who gave us some suggestions on how to handle the project. He lend us motors and gave us stretch goals to work on by the end of this week. We made a [Gantt chart](http://iamtechknow.github.io/118website/#gantt) to visualize our goals for next week. We plan to have an autonomous drivable robot by next Saturday! 

We are going to attempt the Beer checkup minimum specification requirement as minimally as possible. To adapt our design for this, we ditched our ultrasonic and IR beacon detector sensors and rotating servo platform and will look into it for the competition. We also decided to rely just on gravity to launch our balls. We'll look into motors to launch the ball, but we think the ball may have enough potential energy to launch a few feet out to hit the opponent droid when it is motionless. We think this will avoid feature creep when meeting minimum requirements.

We also got our tape sensors to function correctly in time for the upcoming checkoff. We wired reflective optical sensors to toggle an LED's brightness when it is over and not over black tape. We found the optimal distance to be a couple centimeters, we will solder wires onto the sensors and mount them to our robot to position them.

As of now we are implementing our Solidworks CAD model to later prototype our robot by cutting parts out of a MDF sheet, working on our system block diagram and the top two levels of our finite state machine, and purchasing the parts we need to prototype our robot.

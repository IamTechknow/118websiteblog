title: We survived!
---

<p>After much relaxation, I (Edmond) can finally say...</p>

<p>We survived!</p>

<p>On the day we checked off, we were starting to get successful runs when generating checkoff setups. The line tracking still did not always work, but procuring the enemy and portal almost always worked. Still we had to go through one failed check off.</p>

<p>On the last attempt on our second check off that day, our robot miraciousally checked off. First it spent nearly the first minute wandering around to find black tape. Then it went towards the ammo depot diagonally, bumped with it, and the balls fell into the ammo funnel! We have no idea how it achieved this, all we know is that it will never do it again! The rest of the checkoff may be observed <a href="http://iamtechknow.github.io/118website/images/videos/most_accidential_cmpe118_checkoff.mp4">in this video.</a> The checkoff did not happen completely accidentially because the shaking was intentional, but that is very likely the most miracious Mechatronics checkoff ever!</p>

<p>Immediately after we checked off we had to disassemble our robot to give back loaned parts, but we move on!</p>

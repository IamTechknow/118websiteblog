title: Another Update
---
<p>
Spend another long day in the lab.Spent a lot of the night in 138 lab, on the field so can test the bot. 
My hope was to get the findingEnemy sub state machine completely working. Unfortunately it took me a lot longer
then i hoped it would. 

When I called it a night I had done the following:
<ul>

<li>

<h3>FindingAmmoSubHSM</h3>
now is capable of a few more things. If started not facing black tape it does maneuvers until, gets to black tape. Added new techniques for 
determining difference between asteroids and ammo depot. Note not perfect yet
</li>

<li>
<h3>FindingEnemySubHSM</h3>
basic idea, get ammo do 180 degree turn bump center obstacle, then wall ride until get beacon reading, also thinking of adding 360 turn while wall riding. 
Got locked out of 138 so testing limited.
</li>

</ul>
The plan for tomorrow is work on the third level, plunger placement, and funnel and servo. Then when have access to PIC32, continue testing FindingEnemySubHSM, 
so thats it pretty robust. and Integrate the beacon detector to see how it picks up the beacon. Already got a module written so hope will get this working relatively fast

Note for team: I feel like a gravity launcher could simplify setup and have seen it work pretty well. Just a though i had.

---

<p>
My first blog post. The last few days were spend locking down the mechanical design of our robot. By thursday we believe we came up a with solid design, and are ready to move forward with it. The hope is by Friday night can get everything mounted and get all our sensors working. And Continue working at adding capabilities to our HSM, as things are added to the bot.

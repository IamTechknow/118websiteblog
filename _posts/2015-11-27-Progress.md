title: Another Update
---

<p>
Spent a good amount of the the day in lab. Made some good progress. With Line following working. Today we worked on getting the bot to get on the the black tape "T", and get some ammo. This involved adding two more sub state machines, Our third levels, FindingTSubSubHSM and AligningTSubSubHSM. Im working on documenting the state machines in Umlet and will post once they are done. Essentially these state machines wall ride the depots, until it gets to the "T" and then AligingTSubSubHSM works to get lined up perfectly to release the ammo.

Additionally, we added some capabilities to our FindingAmmoHSM. So it is now capable of reacting to bumps in the field. Like from asteroids. So if it hits an asteroid while wall riding, it can detect it and continue in getting the ammo.

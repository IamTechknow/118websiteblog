title: Laser Cutting
---

<p>Last night we finally got a chance to laser cut our base in MDF and Foamcore. Here are our lessons we learned:</p> <br />

<ol>For Foamcore:
	<li>4 inch screws can support second floor well</li>
	<li>The motor mount area is not really necessary and is more of an hinderance due to a short motor shaft. We will probably remove it and secure it with pipe insulators with rubber.</li>
	<li>The Uno32 base floor has big floors to allow wires to go throughout the robot. However the holes are too close, they need to be far enough to allow smaller holes where screws go through to secure the Uno stack to exist. Otherwise, the Uno32 stack, and h-bridge and uln2003 boards should fit</li>
	<li>The caster wheel does not raise the drivetrain wheels from the surface, but the hex nuts we used to secure it may get in the way of the caster wheel. This idea could work, but if we can't use different screws or raise the hex nut then we will have to abandon it.</li>
	<li>The bump sensors we used are hard to trigger, they don't have the whisker mechanism. The ammo plunger does not move when we push it towards the ammo depot to make it dispense ammo.</li>
	<li>The launcher pipe does not fit through the hole on the 2nd floor base, the model represents a 1.5 inch diameter hole that does fit through a pipe model of that size. We are using a 2 inch diameter hole. We will look into this but for now will make the circular cut bigger</li>
	<li>We need to lower the side panel so it can fit with the 4 inch thread screws. The ammo plunger is above the middle of the ammo depot mechanism used to release the balls when pushed. With wheels, the plunger will be raised even higher.</li>

</ol> <br />

<p>For MDF, Our motor mounts have a few design flaws that will make us consider trashing it. It takes up too much precious space on the motor shaft that when attached with the wheel, the wheel touches the MDF which will not allow it to move well. However we need to find another way to mount a base for our sensors</p> <br />

<p>For Acrylic Our hub cap to mount the drivetrain wheel with the motor fits but is not tight enough. If we look close enough there is a tiny gap between the cap and the wheel. Not all cuts are equal, so we will refrain from editing our solidworks model to get a more precise fit due to diminishing returns and we could secure the wheel mount by gluing it to the wheel. 

<br/>
We are going to remount our motors by using our pipe mount and redesign a base that we can place our sensors on. There will be hole slots we can remove so hopefully this will free up space on our primary base to remount our motors and base.
